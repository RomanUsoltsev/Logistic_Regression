# Logistic_Regression
Logistic regression. Neural networks using the python language

As part of the task (task.ipynb), a project has been implemented, it is a simple neural network,
based on logistic regression, which allows you to recognize cats in pictures.
The neural network can be trained to identify other objects in the pictures, just change
training and test set, which is located in the datasets folder.


The test_fun.py file implements a function (user_check_image(path)) that allows you to recognize objects on
custom images, specifying a relative path to it.

There is also an implementation in the main.ipynb format (opens with Jupyter or Google Colaboratory).
